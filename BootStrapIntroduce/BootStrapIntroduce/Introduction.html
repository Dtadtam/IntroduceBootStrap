                    In the “Writing with Purpose” section of the Pattern Based Writing: Quick & Easy Essay program, students learn to apply their new writing strategies to different types (or modes) of writing. The truth is — it’s quite easy to get students writing many different types of paragraphs when they have the right foundation.
                    Put simply, all of these different types of paragraphs simply involve layering on a different purpose or intent. When students have the right foundation, it’s just that simple.
                    What are you trying to achieve in this paragraph and in your whole composition? What is your purpose right here? Do you wish to describe? Do you want to evaluate? Is your goal to narrate? Is your intent to persuade?
                    When students don’t have a proper foundation, these questions don’t mean much to them.  After Pattern Based Writing: Quick & Easy Essay, these questions mean a great deal.
